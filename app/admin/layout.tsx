/**
 * app/admin/layout.tsx
 *
 * This layout's metadata OVERRIDES the root layout's metadata for all /admin/*
 * pages. The key override is `manifest: '/admin-manifest.json'` — this is
 * what tells iOS to use the admin-specific manifest when the user visits any
 * /admin/* page and taps "Add to Home Screen".
 *
 * Because we removed the hardcoded <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">
 * from app/layout.tsx's <head>, Next.js now correctly injects ONLY the admin
 * manifest link on admin pages (instead of both, with the root one winning).
 *
 * iOS PWA install flow on /admin/dashboard:
 *   1. iOS reads <link rel="manifest" href="/admin-manifest.json">   ← this layout
 *   2. Fetches admin-manifest.json → start_url: "/admin", scope: "/admin"
 *   3. Installs PWA with correct start_url → opens /admin on launch  ✓
 *   4. Wakes admin-sw.js (scope "/admin") for push delivery          ✓
 *
 * THEME ISOLATION:
 *   The admin panel is always dark — permanently. Even if the visitor toggles
 *   light/dark on the public portfolio (via next-themes writing to localStorage
 *   and adding/removing the `dark` class on <html>), the AdminDarkLock
 *   component below re-applies `dark` on every render cycle so the admin UI
 *   is never affected. When the user navigates away from /admin/* the original
 *   theme class is restored, so the public portfolio is untouched.
